# DKR - Vagas

# Getting started
- Clone the repository
```
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-Node-Starter.git <project_name>
```
- Install dependencies
```
cd <project_name>
npm install
```
- Configure your mongoDB server
```bash
# create the db directory
sudo mkdir -p /data/db
# give the db correct read/write permissions
sudo chmod 777 /data/db

# starting from macOS 10.15 even the admin cannot create directory at root
# so lets create the db diretory under the home directory.
mkdir -p ~/data/db
# user account has automatically read and write permissions for ~/data/db.
```
- Start your mongoDB server (you'll probably want another command prompt)
```bash
mongod

# on macOS 10.15 or above the db directory is under home directory
mongod --dbpath ~/data/db
```
- Build and run the project
```
npm run build
npm start
```
Or, if you're using VS Code, you can use `cmd + shift + b` to run the default build task (which is mapped to `npm run build`), and then you can use the command palette (`cmd + shift + p`) and select `Tasks: Run Task` > `npm: start` to run `npm start` for you.

> **Note on editors!** - TypeScript has great support in [every editor](http://www.typescriptlang.org/index.html#download-links), but this project has been pre-configured for use with [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
Throughout the README We will try to call out specific places where VS Code really shines or where this project has been setup to take advantage of specific features.

Finally, navigate to `http://localhost:3000` and you should see the template being served and rendered locally!

### Build the app
Building the app locally is required to generate a zip to deploy because the App Service won't execute build tasks.
Build the app however you normally would:
- `ctrl + shift + b` - kicks off default build in VS Code
- execute `npm run build` from a terminal window


### Troubleshooting failed deployments
Deployment can fail for various reasons, if you get stuck with a page that says *Service Unavailable* or some other error, [open an issue](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-Node-Starter/issues/new) and I'll try to help you resolve the problems.

# TypeScript + Node
In the next few sections I will call out everything that changes when adding TypeScript to an Express project.
Note that all of this has already been setup for this project, but feel free to use this as a reference for converting other Node.js projects to TypeScript.


Basically we are telling Jest that we want it to consume all files that match the pattern `"**/test/**/*.test.(ts|js)"` (all `.test.ts`/`.test.js` files in the `test` folder), but we want to preprocess the `.ts` files first.
This preprocess step is very flexible, but in our case, we just want to compile our TypeScript to JavaScript using our `tsconfig.json`.
This all happens in memory when you run the tests, so there are no output `.js` test files for you to manage.

### Running tests
Simply run `npm run test`.
Note this will also generate a coverage report.

### Writing tests
Writing tests for web apps has entire books dedicated to it and best practices are strongly influenced by personal style, so I'm deliberately avoiding discussing how or when to write tests in this guide.
However, if prescriptive guidance on testing is something that you're interested in, [let me know](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/LN2CV82), I'll do some homework and get back to you.

## ESLint
ESLint is a code linter which mainly helps catch quickly minor code quality and style issues.

### ESLint rules
Like most linters, ESLint has a wide set of configurable rules as well as support for custom rule sets.
All rules are configured through `.eslintrc` configuration file.
In this project, we are using a fairly basic set of rules with no additional custom rules.

### Running ESLint
Like the rest of our build steps, we use npm scripts to invoke ESLint.
To run ESLint you can call the main build script or just the ESLint task.
```
npm run build   // runs full build including ESLint
npm run lint    // runs only ESLint
```
Notice that ESLint is not a part of the main watch task.

If you are interested in seeing ESLint feedback as soon as possible, I strongly recommend the [VS Code ESLint extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint).
